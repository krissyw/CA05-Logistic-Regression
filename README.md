# CA05-Logistic-Regression

## Background
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) kills more people than cancer globally. A dataset of real heart patients
collected from a 15 year heart study cohort is made available for this assignment. The dataset has 16
patient features. Note that none of the features include any Blood Test information.

## Dataset 
The dataset can be downloaded via this link: https://github.com/krissyw/CA05-Logistic-Regression

## Code 
Python notebook can be found using this link: https://github.com/krissyw/CA05-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/Krissy_Wong_CA05_Logistic_Regression.ipynb


## Installation 
Be aready to mount the drive from Google Drive:

from google.colab import drive drive.mount('/gdrive')

In order for the program to run properly, make sure your csv files are located in paths as follows: For example: '/gdrive/MyDrive/BSAN6070/CA03/census_data.csv'
